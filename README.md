# MERN_App_CRE
This is a work-in-progress webapp built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) via UDemy template. The end-goal is to have multiple matters tracked (e.g., closing date for real estate, outstanding documents, deadline for certain signatures, etc), client contact information, and deadlines.
